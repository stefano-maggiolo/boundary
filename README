This program generates the dual graph of stable curves.

Description of the sources:

- boundary.* is the main file, that parses command line and call
  everything else.

- graph.* contains the class Graph, that describes a colored graph
  (stable or not); also, contains the class GraphClass, that stores
  some of the invariants of a graph.

- *printer.* are the classes that provides printing facilities of the
  graphs; the one without the prefix is an interface, the others print
  graphs in different ways (does not print, print text, latex source,
  or in a compact binary format).

- *computer.* are the classes that do the actual computation; again,
  the one without a prefix is the interface, boundary_computer.cpp is
  the only one working, ct_computer should compute compact tail stable
  graphs (but currently does not work), and boundary_computer_2 is an
  alternative approach that currently does not work.

- *reader.* are the classes that transform input in some form in
  object of the class Graph; currently not used.

- constants.h describes the limits under which the program works; in
  particular, every number must be inside the range of "uchar" and G
  and N must be under the limits stated.
